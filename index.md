  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <h3>Distributed Network</h3>
  <p>Devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers join our global network, sharing their idle processing power. Together, we form a powerful, decentralized computing grid capable of tackling a wide range of tasks.</p>

  <h3>Redundant Data Storage</h3>
  <p>Inspired by RAID 5, we store data with redundancy across multiple devices to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. This approach enhances data security and availability, making our network resilient to individual device failures.</p>

  <h3>Web 3.0 Integration</h3>
  <p>Utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts, Humanity Grid manages and verifies transactions, ensuring transparency and security within the network. This integration supports a decentralized and trustless environment, where participants can confidently contribute and collaborate.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of technical background or resources. Your device’s idle processing power can make a difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Community-Driven:</strong> Our platform is open-source and collaborative, inviting innovation from developers, researchers, and tech enthusiasts. Your input is crucial for our continuous improvement and expansion.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable Solutions:</strong> Beyond initial tasks like prime number calculations, our platform can expand to address various scientific, medical, and environmental challenges.</li>
    <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Participants earn tokens for their contributions, promoting active involvement and rewarding participation.</li>
  </ul>
